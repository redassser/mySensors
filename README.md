# PRODUCT CONCEPT

For a few days now I've been looking for an activity tracker. Your fitbits and whatnot. 
The problem is that I do NOT want a screen on my wrist. Why?

1. It's a detriment to battery life and I'd really like something that lasts a very long time before needing a charge.
    - Similarly, constant calculations and interrupts can be taxing on the battery.
2. It doesn't fit my style. I'm a no accessory kind of guy and having a big obvious thing on my wrist would stick out.
3. I prefer using my phone for data analysis, bigger screen is nicer. Also it would alleviate some cpu cost on the tracker.

Ideally it would just be the sensors on a strap or clip or something and send the data to my phone via bluetooth.

It would also ideally have a paired purpose-built app that LOCALLY stores relevant data. I hate the fact that it sends all your heartrate and sleep data and everything to servers. I should NOT have to login to my WATCH!!!!!!!!

Having an account for a watch is a solution only necessary because these manufacturers created the security problem by sending all my personal info to a server somewhere. I have a computer in my POCKET at ALL TIMES. You dont NEED my data.

Real example \/ The Amazon Halo

I love the form factor and look. It'd be cool to just have a strap on my arm that actually had everything a smart watch had without the stupid screen. Maybe a little smaller sensors would be nice but that might be impossible.
But of course Amazon owns it. So all your data gets whisked away to a far away server, then they have the GALL to CHARGE YOU a subscribtion for the privelage of storing your data. 

## Local Data

- Data must be stored locally, for privacy of course but also to just avoid server cost. How much data could it be?

In my research I've read about so many now-defunct companies who made fitness trackers, and then went out of business a few years later after gouging money. Including the Amazon Halo. 

The Amazon Halo had big plans to add an AI personal trainer thing, update the app massively, etc etc. All these things cost significant amounts of invenstment and continued development, and increasing server costs. No wonder. 

## Open Data Format

The reason you need a specific app for a specific watch is because 

1. Watches that use android wear need an android phone in order to connect to messaging services and stuff like that. 
2. If its subscription based, then obviously there must be a reason to pay for it, as well as somewhere the data is going thats needed. 
3. App developers might target only one platform of watches because it takes a lot of time to develop for multiple complicated services and platforms. 

I'd like a watch that just sent a plain data packet every second or so, with all the data required to achieve the desired analysis. 

## Types of Sensors

### **REQUIRED**

- Heart Rate Monitor
- Oximeter
- Accelerometer

### **INTERESTING**

- Skin Conductance
- Skin Temp 
- Magnemeter

HR and step tracking is pretty necessary, sleep tracking would be nice.
